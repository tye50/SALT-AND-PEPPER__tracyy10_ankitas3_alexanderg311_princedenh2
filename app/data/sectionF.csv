White House Staff Reportedly Went Behind Trump’s Back On HUGE Issue Because Trump Is Too Reckless,"Remember when Trump said that we were done with NAFTA, and rumors swirled that he was drafting an executive order withdrawing us from the agreement? And remember how he softened that position very quickly? It seems that he wasn t the one to reach out to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on that, nor did Trudeau call him of his own accord.White House officials reached out to him behind Trump s back.Why? Because they were concerned that Trump would unilaterally yank us out of it, hurting multiple sectors of our economy and doing zero favors for Canada and Mexico as well. So, according to Canada s National Post newspaper, they contacted Trudeau themselves: The unconventional diplomatic manoeuvre  approaching the head of a foreign government to influence your own boss  proved decisive, as Trump thereafter abandoned his threat to pull out of NAFTA unilaterally, citing the arguments made by Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto as pivotal. Trump, in a childish tantrum, slapped a 20 percent tariff on imports of softwood lumber from Canada, claiming that our agreement with them over that was unfair. He wholly neglected other parts of our trade relationship with Canada, including the fact that they import a lot more dairy from us than they export to us.In other words, if Trump would actually take a look at how things are working, he might find that things aren t quite as unfair to us as he makes them out to be with his tantrums.Trump has also threatened to levy massive taxes on products imported from Rexnord a company that just closed its Indiana plant and laid off more than 300 workers as punishment for sending its jobs to Mexico:Rexnord of Indiana made a deal during the Obama Administration to move to Mexico. Fired their employees. Tax product big that s sold in U.S.  Donald J.

 Donald Trump Just Changed His Twitter Header And The Whole Internet Is Making Fun Of Him (TWEETS),"Donald Trump spent Monday pretty much just making an ass of himself on Twitter. After he attempted to intimidate Sally Yates and tweeted numerous lies about the hearing later in the day, one might assume The Donald would take a break. Instead, he took one of those aforementioned lies and blasted it across the top of his Twitter profile.The header, as you can see, features the whitest room of people you have ever seen all giving a thumbs up and   because he s a narcissist   one of his own quotes, which is a lie: Director Clapper reiterated what everybody, including the fake media already knows- there is  no evidence  of collusion w/ Russia and Trump. Naturally, Twitter is having a lot of fun with this:Never really believed there was collusion between Trump & Russia.. until he just put that twitter header up.

Clapper explained that he was not aware of any evidence demonstrating collusion, but that he was unaware of the FBI investigation into the administration s dealings with Russia until Director James Comey announced its existence publicly in March. That s a far cry from  no evidence. The real story   the one Trump doesn t want you to know   is that Sally Yates confirmed under oath that she warned Donald Trump General Mike Flynn was compromised 18 days before Trump did anything about it. We believed that Gen. Flynn was compromised with respect to the Russian,  Yates said.  To state the obvious, you don t want your national security adviser compromised with the Russians.

 Trump Has Extremely Inappropriate Reaction To Being Contradicted By His Own National Security Adviser,"The majority of America has already noticed   and figured it out a long time ago   that Donald Trump doesn t have a measured, steady reaction to anything. Widely known for his lack of mental and emotional stability, America s new failing president continues to horrify the nation (and the world) with his over-the-top, inappropriate reactions to even the most straightforward issues and disagreements. How Trump treats members of his own team is a perfect example of this.Last month, Trump made a controversial remark when he insisted that South Korea should pay for the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), a missile defense system that would help keep North Korea at bay. As Trump frequently talks out of his a** and makes statements that have no basis in reality, he was quickly contradicted by his own National Security Adviser, H.R. McMaster. In a public statement, McMaster stepped in and quickly assured the Korean government that the cost of THAAD would be taken care of by the United States. Apparently, Trump didn t take that too well.According to Bloomberg, it s just been revealed that Trump lost his sh*t over this and tore his own adviser a new one over the phone. Bloomberg reported: Trump was livid, according to three White House officials, after reading in the Wall Street Journal that McMaster had called his South Korean counterpart to assure him that the president s threat to make that country pay for a new missile defense system was not official policy. These officials say Trump screamed at McMaster on a phone call, accusing him of undercutting efforts to get South Korea to pay its fair share. Trump, as usual, was having a highly inappropriate reaction to his fragile ego being bruised. Apparently, this isn t even the first and only time something like this has happened. Bloomberg stated that in private, Trump calls McMaster the general undermining my policy  and appears regretful that he appointed him.The lack of trust and in-fighting we ve seen in the Trump administration   as well as Trump s lack of respect for the advisers HE appointed   is unprecedented on so many levels. This administration continues to be an embarrassment to this country, and most of us can t wait until this nightmare is over.Featured image via Pool / Getty Images",News,"May 8, 2017"
 Condoleezza Rice: ‘America Was Born With A Birth Defect – Slavery’ (VIDEO),"Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice sat down for an interview on Sunday and had a few words to say about the birth of America, which was plagued by slavery from its very conception.While discussing her newest book, Democracy: Stories from the Long Road to Freedom,  Rice told CBS  Sunday Morning that the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s was the second founding of America. We forget in the United States how long it has taken us to make  We the People  mean people like me. And indeed, I do think that America was born with a birth defect; it was slavery. And so I do think that when we were finally able to deliver the promise of the Constitution to people like me, little girls growing up in Birmingham, Alabama, when finally my father was able to vote without difficulty, yes, it s the second founding of America. The first founding wasn t quite complete. Rice, who spent eight years in the White House serving as national security adviser and secretary of state under President George W. Bush, also called forth a memory from her childhood during the interview. She grew up in Alabama, where Jim Crow was the law of the land. In the summers, her family would travel to Denver. However, these were not your average family vacations. Rather, they were a quest for an education denied to them because of the color of their skin. If you were black, you couldn t go to the University of Alabama for graduate school in 1961,  she said.  And so my father, who was getting an advanced degree in student personnel administration, and my mother, who was qualifying to teach music in the schools   she was a science teacher before that   would go to Denver.

And it does not exist in the world of Donald Trump. This is the most important election of the last hundred years,  she said.  We have to be very certain that we elect a person who has experience, knowledge, a base of education in the world of world politics as well as domestic politics and so obviously I m voting for Hillary Clinton.

 Sally Yates Just Opened A Can Of Constitutional Whoop Ass On Ted Cruz (VIDEO),"During testimony in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee on Monday, former acting Attorney General Sally Yates revealed that she warned Trump administration officials three times about former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. The hearing today involved Russia s meddling in the 2016 election so of course, Ted Cruz grilled Yates about her thoughts on Trump s attempt to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. That, of course, makes no sense but Cruz was trying to defend the man who previously insulted his wife s looks during the campaign.Yates was fired as acting AG after refusing to defend Trump s executive order, which she said violated the U.S. Constitution s religious protections.Cruz told Yates that the Office of Legal Counsel had issued a determination that the executive order was legal, but Yates countered that finding by saying it ignored the First Amendment in favor of an obscure statute which had since been updated. In this particular instance, particularly where we were talking about a fundamental issue of religious freedom, not the interpretation of some arcane statute, but religion freedom, it was appropriate for us to look at the intent behind the president s actions and the intent is laid out in his statements,  Yates said.Yates said she did not believe Trump s executive order was  lawful  and used  religious freedom  to defend herself from Cruz s attack on her.When Cruz quoted part of the Constitution, Yates came back at him with a statute which she said  Trumps the first one you described. In the over 200 years of the Department of Justice history, are you aware of any instance in which the Department of Justice has formally approved the legality of a policy and three days later the attorney general has directed the department not to follow that policy and to defy that policy?  Cruz asked. I m not, but I m also not aware of a situation where the Office of Legal Counsel was advised not to tell the attorney general about it until after it was over,  Yates replied.Watch:Rep. John Cornyn, too, brought up the Executive Order to Yates and that didn t go down well either. Yates brought up  intent  again in regards to Trump s Muslim ban. In fact, just this morning after White House press secretary Sean Spicer was asked by ABC s Cecilia Varga about the alleged president s website literally having the words  preventing Muslim immigration  written on it, it was scrubbed.So now we re back to the  intent  behind Trump s executive order again.One does not simply delete something from the Internet, though.Moments after Spicer was asked about this Trump campaign page calling for a Muslim ban, it went blank. But Wayback Machine still has it pic.twitter.com/OAQnVNwpdi  Robert Maguire (@RobertMaguire_) May 8, 2017The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals is hearing oral arguments Monday for Trump s revised Muslim travel ban, which called for a 120-day halt on all refugee resettlement and a 90-day pause on immigrants from six Muslim-majority countries entering the U.S. The previous order sought to halt immigrants from entering the U.S. from seven Muslim-majority countries.We need a clean up on aisle three.

" Officials: Obama Warned About Flynn, But Trump Thought He Was Joking","The Trump administration has finally, definitively, admitted that President Obama personally warned Donald Trump about hiring Michael Flynn within 48 hours of the election .The conversation occurred during the 90-minute sitdown the former President and the guy who was kinda-sorta elected by a minority of the population (and Russia) and against the wishes of most Americans.A senior Obama official tells NBC that the President, who actually fired the disgraced Trump foreign policy advisor in 2014, made it very clear that he is   not a fan of Michael Flynn.  NBC reports:According to all three former officials, Obama warned Trump against hiring Flynn. The Obama administration fired Flynn in 2014 from his position as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, largely because of mismanagement and temperament issues.Obama s warning pre-dated the concerns inside the government about Flynn s contacts with the Russian ambassador, one of the officials said. Obama passed along a general caution that he believed Flynn was not suitable for such a high level post, the official added.Two administration officials said Obama also warned Trump to stay vigilant on North Korea.One official says that Trump thought the remark was made  in jest,  according to NBC.Recently, Trump attempted to blame President Obama for his failure to vet Flynn.  General Flynn was given the highest security clearance by the Obama Administration   but the Fake News seldom likes talking about that,  The Donald tweeted Monday as Sally Yates was preparing to testify.But in fact, it was his team   not Obama s   who failed to vet the former General. When Flynn was fired, for example, he had not even completed a CIA background check.NEW: Flynn never received broader security clearance needed to serve as Natl Security Advisor before his firing. via @KenDilanianNBC pic.twitter.com/xDDFxtYjuW  Peter Alexander (@PeterAlexander) May 8, 2017Trump has a lot to be worried about right now   and more will be coming.Featured image via Getty Images (Pool)",News,"May 8, 2017"
 Sally Yates Bombshell: Trump Was Warned Flynn Was Exposing White House To Blackmail (VIDEO),"Sally Yates  testimony before a congressional committee on the events leading up to Trump s disgraced former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn  resigning  and her own firing for speaking out against him had always promised to contain some explosive revelations. And it didn t take long for the match to be lit.Early into Yates  appearance in front of the committee, she got down to brass tacks. She had told Trump three separate times that Michael Flynn was trouble. In every case she was ignored, save for White House counsel demanding to know whether Flynn was facing a criminal charge. What s more, Yates testified that she has specifically told the Trump administration that there was a great deal of evidence to suggest Flynn was either susceptible to blackmail from the Russians or already compromised. Again, she was ignored and then later fired.Particularly damning, Yates said that she watched in horror as Flynn s own lies about his involvement with the Russians was being passed along to the media by others within the administration, including Vice President Mike Pence. (Pence later confirmed this by claiming he had believed what Flynn was telling him at the time.) She noted that this created a situation where the national security adviser was digging an increasingly deep hole for himself with lies and implicating everyone around him as well. She added that this was not lost on the Russians, who   given their relationship with Flynn   were holding cold, hard proof of Flynn s lies and could threaten to release it at any time.Yates:  the National Security Adviser, essentially, could be blackmailed by the Russians.   via @MSNBC pic.twitter.com/DTIAQcZ6y0  Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) May 8, 2017It s a classic blackmail set up: Let the mark get in too deep, make sure the risk of exposure is too big a cost to bear, then use that vulnerability against him or her.Unfortunately, Trump s administration chose to stick by Flynn rather than slip out of the noose that was rapidly tightening around their necks. Making matters worse, by repeating Flynn s lies, they were also exposing themselves to blackmail. A White House run by a person famous for never apologizing to anyone in his life was walking headlong into a massive scandal   what would they do to avoid responsibility for it?As Yates put it:  You don t want the national security adviser to be in a position where the Russians have leverage over him At some point, the debate over what exactly Trump knew and when he knew it becomes moot. Even if Trump were completely blameless in the coordinated relationship between his trusted adviser and the country undermining American democracy, it would only reinforce that his stupidity qualified as criminal negligence. Obama warned him. Yates warned him. The FBI warned him. The media warned him. And he ignored all of them to protect his friend   a man now claiming to be a foreign agent.Featured image via Twitter",News,"May 8, 2017"
 Trump Hired Flynn After Obama SPECIFICALLY Warned Him Not To – Now Karma Is Coming For Trump. Hard.,"Trump s latest attempt to pass blame for his own mistakes onto others is backfiring in spectacular fashion. Like a broken record, Trump lashed out at former acting Attorney General Sally Yates, who is set to testify that she emphatically warned Trump s administration about the dangers of appointing disgraced general Michael Flynn as his national security adviser. He also tried to pin the blame on Obama, justifying his hiring of Flynn on the basis of Obama having hired him during his administration   ignoring one major detail.General Flynn was given the highest security clearance by the Obama Administration   but the Fake News seldom likes talking about that.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 8, 2017Trump thinks you re dumb enough to not realize that Obama also fired Flynn for being erratic and angry to such a degree that it disturbed his colleagues and staffers.2012 Obama appoints Flynn DIA2014 Obama fires him2016 DOD renews Flynn's clearance2016- With no apparent vetting Trump appoints him NSA https://t.co/6f0dOlpn64  Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) May 8, 2017However, his peculiarly fierce attacks directed at Obama over Flynn betray his Achilles heel. He is a one-trick pony   anything he is guilty of, he accuses others of being responsible for. In this case, it turns out Obama had actually warned Trump about hiring Flynn. In an Oval Office meeting just days after Trump had won the election, Obama sat him down and explained that his trusted adviser   who Trump was reportedly considering naming vice president   was unfit for office.NBC News:According to all three former officials, Obama warned Trump against hiring Flynn. The Obama administration fired Flynn in 2014 from his position as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, largely because of mismanagement and temperament issues.Obama s warning pre-dated the concerns inside the government about Flynn s contacts with the Russian ambassador, one of the officials said. Obama passed along a general caution that he believed Flynn was not suitable for such a high level post, the official added.By all accounts, Trump only got more interested in hiring Flynn after Obama s warning. Like many of his Republican brethren, Trump has long suffered from a knee-jerk reaction to do the opposite of anything Obama says. If Obama says healthcare is good, Republicans come out against it. If Obama says breathing is good, Republicans will hold their breath until they re blue in the face. And apparently if Obama says  Don t hire this unstable, incompetent nutjob to serve in one of the most important roles in the White House,  Trump fast-tracks his application.The irony, of course, is that by deliberately ignoring Obama s warning, Trump made the bed he s currently sleeping in. The fact that he tried to cover up his mistake by firing Sally Yates when she, too, warned him about Flynn only makes things worse for him. Trump is most certainly guilty of many things, but at the forefront is his own rank stupidity and creepy obsession with Obama.His ugliest traits conspired to undo him.How fitting.Featured image via Jack Gruber-Pool/Getty Images",News,"May 8, 2017"

 Trump Just FAILED Hundreds Of Manufacturing Workers And Blamed Obama For It,"Last year, Trump claimed he was succeeding at saving manufacturing jobs by making individual deals with individual companies, like Carrier in Indiana. At the time, people pointed out that he was boasting about the Carrier deal while totally ignoring another Indiana company, Rexnord, that was likewise shipping its jobs to Mexico.And now, Rexnord has done so. NBC News did a report on the plant s closure, which Trump must have watched because he felt the need to lay the blame for this on Obama shortly after it aired:Rexnord of Indiana made a deal during the Obama Administration to move to Mexico. Fired their employees. Tax product big that s sold in U.S.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 7, 2017The funny thing is that if he hadn t been bragging about how great he was at saving manufacturing jobs the instant he won the election, and threatening companies who were trying to outsource, he might actually have a case to make. But he promised to save these kinds of jobs and implied that he would do it company by company if he had to.All he did with Rexnord was tweet at them, which did nothing to sway their decision. And their employees feel as though Trump failed them. As one employee said: In the long run, he s done forgot about us  cause he s moved on to bigger and better things. Perhaps this little plant was just too little for Trump to bother with. The move will save Rexnord tens of millions of dollars, because they can pay Mexican workers $3 per hour vs. the $25 per hour they were paying their American workers. Regardless, this is what Trump said back in December, shortly after claiming victory with both Ford and Carrier:Rexnord of Indiana is moving to Mexico and rather viciously firing all of its 300 workers. This is happening all over our country. No more!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 3, 2016To our knowledge, Trump never even tried to save these jobs despite calling this company out and threatening them with huge tariffs should they actually do this. This is on his head, not Obama s. You can t brag about how you ll save all these jobs and then blame your predecessor when it doesn t happen.Watch NBC News  report below:Featured image by Olivier Douliery-Pool via Getty Images",News,"May 7, 2017"
 Here’s The Disgusting Propaganda The White House Plans To Use To Smear Sally Yates’ Russia Testimony (DETAILS),"The world is eagerly awaiting the testimony of former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates regarding the Trump/Russia connection. Of course, we all remember how she was promptly fired for refusing to defend Donald Trump and his bigoted administration s unconstitutional Muslim ban. Afterward, it also came out that Yates warned Trump and others in the White House that then-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn was possibly compromised by Russian operatives. He was only fired weeks later when it came out that he lied to Mike Pence about his conversations with the Russians. Now, it seems that the White House has two goals: Smear Sally Yates as some kind of Democratic political hack, and put as much distance as they can between the Trump Administration and Michael Flynn.Now that they cannot stop Sally Yates from telling Congress everything she knows about this Russia mess, it seems that Flynn will be the one to take the fall, and despite his previous loyalty to Trump, the White House is just fine with that. Perhaps this is why Flynn previously asked for immunity so he could tell Congress what he knows. Axios reports that the Trump White House strategy to make themselves look squeaky clean in all of this when they are clearly balls deep is as follows:Of course, the point of portraying Yates as some kind of Obama holdover is to make it seem like she s making the case for Trump s impeachment and the indictment of his officials. She isn t, though. Sally Yates is a career Department of Justice lawyer who has served under both Republican and Democratic administrations. Her only loyalty is to the law.This is all just more of the Trump Administration s lies and propaganda, in order to distract from the fact that this Russia mess is getting hotter and hotter by the day. Hopefully, there is something Sally Yates has to say that will warrant a few arrests   starting in the West Wing of the White House.Featured image via Pete Marovich/Getty Images",News,"May 7, 2017"
 Dem. Senator BLASTS Mitch McConnell For Excluding Women From Panel Drafting New Senate Health Plan,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) announced who he has selected to take on crafting the Senate version of the House-passed American Health Care Act (AHCA), but Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) is having none of it and blasted McConnell for not putting any of the female senators in the group.Feinstein expressed her extreme displeasure with the decision to exclude women from this important panel on Meet the Press. She told Andrea Mitchell, I don t know what the 13 white men, when you have five Republican women who are excluded from that, that these 13 men are supposed to sit down and put something together. One main problem with leaving women off of this key panel is that as passed by the House, the ACHA drastically changed the way pre-existing conditions are treated. Under the Affordable Care Act, premiums could not be raised nor could coverage be denied to people with pre-existing health issues. While many of these problems can affect men and women, such as depression and acne, some only apply to women. For example, pregnancy and problems with menstruation can be considered pre-existing conditions under the House bill.Feinstein noted that women s health care has to be considered when they draft the Senate bill. As for responses to the House bill, The American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, and the National Physicians Alliance have all come out against the ACHA.  Feinstein added, Women s health is a big part of this, and women are a majority of the population and their health interests deserve to be contemplated in any reform. I m really very worried that in the rush to judgment, we create a major healthcare problem for people. And we lose a lot of jobs in so doing and we create a whole atmosphere of unpredictability. For an idea of what they may now consider pre-existing conditions, this is just the short list of what might force someone to pay more under Trump s plan, as passed by the House. By making it legal to charge people more for having these problems, they may not be officially barring them from getting insurance but they will make it too expensive for people to afford it.This list is not complete, but you get the gist. Barring women from any discussions relating to this new draft for the Senate is absolutely absurd and it s just one more reason why we have to keep resisting   they can t be allowed to pass this bill without every voice being heard. Call your senators now before it s too late!Featured image via Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images.",News,"May 7, 2017"
 France REJECTS Far-Right Fascist In LANDSLIDE Victory For Democracy (DETAILS),"All over the western world, we have seen a wave of nationalistic, xenophobic fascism take hold in the last year or so. It is what gave Great Britain its exit from the European Union, or Brexit. It is also what gave the United States Donald Trump. However, as the rest of Europe sees the results and suffering of these tragic mistakes, the tide is turning away from fascistic nationalism and back toward democracy. The Netherlands rejected Geert Wilders, a staunchly nationalistic, far-right candidate who wanted to ban Islam outright from The Netherlands, and who was also endorsed by U.S. Congressman Steve King (R-IA), he of the infamous  somebody else s babies  tweet. The same happened in Austria, where the voters there rejected another right-wing nut. Now, France has become the latest to prove that democracy trumps fascism, as their voters rejoice in the election of centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron over far-right, anti-immigrant lunatic Marine Le Pen.This was no squeaker, either. This was firm rejection of Le Pen s fascistic, bigoted rhetoric and anti-immigrant, nationalistic policies. Macron won with 65% of the French vote, and will hopefully now go quietly into the night now that the she can clearly see that the French people did not want her craziness to become law.There is another side to this, though. Perhaps the French people are seeing what the  change  election has done to us here in America? After all, Marine Le Pen has often been referred to as the French Donald Trump. Hell, Le Pen herself has admitted that Trump s election here in America has given her legitimacy, and she was spotted at Trump Tower in New York City earlier this year. Therefore it should come as no surprise that Trump endorsed her candidacy. They are two of a kind.However, Le Pen s sound defeat should give us all hope. As Trump s disastrous presidency unfolds and his failures mount, perhaps America will come to her senses in 2020 if we happen to survive this, and reject this nationalism and xenophobia. It s the only sensible thing to do.Featured image via video screen capture from Twitter",News,"May 7, 2017"
 WATCH: Kellyanne Conway BASHES Americans Who Oppose Trumpcare: They Are Jeering From The ‘Cheap Seats’,"How is the wicked witch of the White House still allowed to talk on television?When House Republicans passed their Trumpcare bill on Thursday, they did so without reading it or getting a CBO score for it, which made it easier for them to close their eyes and vote to screw over the American people, including their own constituents.Trump s healthcare bill would strip healthcare from millions of Americans. Prior to the Affordable Care Act, 45,000 people in this country died every year due to a lack of accessible and affordable healthcare. The Trumpcare bill would repeal President Obama s signature law and put thousands of Americans at risk of dying because they can t get health insurance.But Kellyanne Conway went on Fox News on Sunday to deny that people die because of not having health insurance. In short, her attempt to defend Trump s bill was pathetic and insulting.First, she referred to Americans who oppose Trump s bill as liars jeering from the  cheap seats. Look, it s easier to jeer from the cheap seats than come up with a message of your own and be honest about the facts,  Conway said.  How did we get here? Why have so many Americans asked for Obamacare to be repealed and replaced? It s because you have premiums that have increased by 40 percent on average. And then she whined about opponents warning that the bill will kill people and accused them of using scare tactics. You know, saying people are going to die   and the enablers in the mainstream media not calling out those breathless, heartless predictions, and going right on to prognostication for 2018. Why in the world are we talking about who is going to win in 2018 when the duty of the mainstream media, of  news reporters  is to tell you what s actually in the bill, not to allow others to scare. Here s the video via YouTube.You know who is really being breathless and heartless? Kellyanne Conway.Once again, she is lying to the American people and insulting everyone who opposes Donald Trump and his downright evil agenda.It is a FACT that thousands of people died every year because they can t afford health insurance.The Affordable Care Act is not perfect, which is why Democrats have offered to work with Republicans to fix what needs to be fixed, but Republicans are so obsessed with erasing every achievement made by President Obama that they are unwilling to do so. They would rather scrap the entire law instead.The problem is that the Republican bill does not protect people with pre-existing conditions. In fact, it classifies pregnancy, PTSD, and sexual assault as pre-existing conditions that would disqualify people from getting health insurance. Furthermore, it slaps senior citizens with an age tax and puts a limit on how long insurance will cover their needs. It also makes them pay MORE for healthcare than they currently do now under the Affordable Care Act.Trump s bill would make it impossible for low-income Americans to afford health insurance, thereby sentencing them to death if they get seriously sick and can t afford care.Basically, Trump s bill really does include death panels, which, interestingly enough, was a lie that Republicans repeatedly used to scare people into opposing the Affordable Care Act. Now they are accusing Democrats of doing the same thing even though Trump s bill would repeal a law that has literally saved thousands of lives over the years. Trump s bill would end those lives.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"May 7, 2017"
 ICYMI: SNL Skewers “Morning Joe” And It Is Hilarious,"This week s cold open for Saturday Night Live featured a parody of the morning show, Morning Joe. The sketch featured Alex Moffat as host Joe Scarborough and Kate McKinnon as Mika Mika Brzezinski. The sketch also has Alec Baldwin as President Donald Trump, who calls into the show as  John Miller,  a spokesperson for the White House. Back in the day, Trump was known for calling reporters all over the New York area pretending to be his own publicist. He would call, not to tout his business successes but to brag about his sex life.The sketch also made fun of the relationship between the hosts. The pair got engaged recently when they were celebrating Mika s 50th birthday.

 Paul Ryan Takes A Monumentally HUMILIATING Photo With A Constituent Who EXPERTLY Trolled Him (IMAGE),"Politicians are all about photo-ops. This is especially true of high-ranking, smarmy types like House Speaker Paul Ryan. However, Speaker Ryan s opportunism got the best of him during the congressional break this weekend, when he wound up taking a picture with a #RESISTANCE activist while Ryan himself was wearing an apron at a shelter of some sort and pretending to care about people.Of course, the members of Congress are taking their break amid the worst, most cruel and craven healthcare bill that has been passed in living memory, and millions of Americans are understandably upset at the prospect of the Republicans taking their healthcare away as these rich assholes celebrate in the White House Rose Garden with Donald Trump. After all, all the House GOP cares about is a win for their egotistical orange  president.  Therefore, it should come as no surprise that a  protester wearing a  Pod Save America  t-shirt that read Repeal and go f*ck yourself,  and that was signed  GOP,  took the opportunity to troll Speaker Ryan so expertly. Here is the shot, via Twitter:Couple friends of the pod hanging out this morning. @jonfavs @jonlovett @TVietor08 pic.twitter.com/aT3nqiyOlu  J (@Minnysconsin) May 6, 2017So, in other words, either Paul Ryan KNOWS people hate him around the nation, or he is too ignorant to realize how much people hate him. Or, most likely, he s been in Congress so long he thinks he cannot get voted out, and therefore doesn t care what his policies do to ordinary Americans   up to an including death   just so long as he and his rich buddies get their tax cuts. The latter is the most likely scenario, and we should all remember that. Wisconsinites   look at who this guy is. VOTE. HIM. OUT. SHOCK HIM in 2018.

 MSNBC BRILLIANTLY Smacks Offended Trumpkins Who Want Colbert Fired For A Joke (VIDEO),"By now, everyone knows that Stephen Colbert laid into Donald Trump in spectacular fashion on Monday night with a tirade that culminated with the Late Show host declaring that the wannabe president s mouth isn t good for anything but serving as Russian President Vladimir Putin s  cock holster.  Now, considering all the vulgar language Trump has used and continues to use, and his cavalier attitude toward said language   and, in some cases, even actions   one would think this sort of thing would be accepted as par for the course in this administration. But, alas, common sense is scarce here, so of course Trump and his supporters are offended. Hell, even the Federal Communications Commission is trying to go after Colbert for the joke. Well, an MSNBC panel has just about had enough of the double standards and hypocrisy on this one, and they let Trump and his cronies know it on Saturday.Dean Obeidallah, Scott Blakeman and Judy Gold appeared on Saturday s edition of Joy Reid s weekend show, AM Joy, and lit into the people going after Colbert for making fun of Trump in a crude way. First, Obeidallah railed against the idea that GOP types could ever think   much less care   that joke was homophobic. He also alluded to how it is Trump who took our politics into the gutter, and therefore he is not immune to being the subject of such crude jokes: Nothing is off limits with this guy. I think comedians are playing a role in preventing him from being normalized. Too bad little snowflakes. We re going to make as many jokes as we want. You need a safe space, go hide. Put on your big boy pants because it s just beginning. Judy Gold then chimed in, reminding everyone that right-wingers bitched about Ann Coulter being too nasty to speak at Berkeley, and how right-wingers reacted to that. Either they like free speech or they don t. Gold said: The outrage that we had to listen to about Ann Coulter and her hate speech at Berkeley that the conservatives were,  Oh, you know, there s too much political correctness, too much of this and too much of that.  Colbert is a comedian. He is telling a joke. Funny is funny. This panel is correct. The Right wants to cry foul if someone shuts down one of their speakers, but they want a late night comedian fined if he says something that is a little too off color for their tastes about their great orange leader. Get used to it, conservatives. Elect a clown, expect a circus. And expect the people who realize what a clown he is to make fun of said clown and its circus.Watch the video below:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 7, 2017"
 Multiple Sclerosis Patient Montel Williams Rips GOP Health Care Bill To Pieces: ‘So Wrong’ (VIDEO),"Montel Williams, who has been fighting Multiple Sclerosis since 1999, ripped the GOP s hideous health care bill, and the Republicans who voted for it, to pieces.The American Health Care Act guts the protections for pre-existing conditions that Obamacare had provided. Under the AHCA, states could opt out of federal regulations and allow insurance companies to charge people with pre-existing conditions as much as they want. This means that sick people, the very people who need medical care the most, could find themselves priced out of insurance coverage.Williams, who has been a vocal advocate for MS, weighed in on the bill during an interview with CNN on Saturday. When by asked by Ana Cabrera what he thought of the AHCA, Williams did not hold back.What people at home don t understand, when you say terms and things like pre-existing conditions, they really are basing this on what an insurance company has stated was a pre-existing condition.So, they think about 22 percent of Americans have a problem right this minute. This is from the National Institutes of Health. Over 56 percent of adult Americans, 120 million adult Americans, have one chronic illness. And around 80 percent of them have at least two.So these numbers that people throw out are so wrong.Cabrera pointed out that Republicans have promised  access  to health care, but what they really mean is that you can get insurance coverage if you are rich enough to pay for it. Williams said that he is lucky to be able to afford whatever health insurance he needs, but most Americans don t have that luxury.He went on to say that many MS patients are already unable to get the medications they need to control this debilitating neurological condition because they don t have insurance. Williams explained that the medication he himself is on costs over $1,500 a month. I also have MS, and the price tag for just one of my medications tops $100,000 a year.Williams says that we need to worry about lowering costs, not signing people s death warrants with heinous bills like the AHCA. He explains that the  normal American  can t afford to pay these kinds of prices for the medicines  that keep them alive. That s what insurance is for,  he added.Watch Montel tear the GOP health care bill to pieces, here:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 6, 2017"
 More Networks Join in the Boycott of New Trump Ad,"If you were not ready to give thought to anything other than politics, you are in luck as the campaign for 2020 has already begun. The Trump/Pence team has already put out its first ad, in which they decry the fake news. This has caused several of the main news networks to say they will not air the new ad.CNN, ABC and NBC has cited a graphic that shows the words  fake news  over the faces of a number of anchors. The rest of the ad is devoted to listing President Donald Trump s accomplishments over the first 100 days that he has been in the White House. The ad goes on to flame the  fake news  for not covering everything the president has done since assuming office.All networks that are not running the ad say that it is inaccurate. ABC News reported that the ad was a personal attack against the network. The reporters who were targeted by the Trump ad were Rachel Maddow, Wolf Blitzer, Andrea Mitchell, Scott Pelley and George Stephanopoulos.Trump s daughter in law weighed in. Lara Trump, Eric s wife, said,  Apparently, the mainstream media are champions of the First Amendment only when it serves their own political views.  She is working on the president s reelection efforts.The campaign is not just making misleading ads, however. They are also actively working on donations and are courting high level donors.The ad also lists the problems the campaign has seen with press coverage of the president and his team. For example, Sean Hannity did a press interview with 60 Minutes and he had a beef with the way they edited the piece. Another example of  fake news  coverage was a segment on The Rachel Maddow Show where a copy of the president s 2005 tax return.The ad will run on FOX News and the FOX Business Network.Featured image via the Trump/Pence campaign.",News,"May 6, 2017"
" In 2011, Stephen Colbert Gave Us A Futuristic View Of Trump’s Presidency; He Wasn’t Far Off (VIDEO)","Stephen Colbert came under fire from conservatives this week for a late night monologue that could best be defined as a rant against Donald Trump. It ended with Colbert saying,  The only thing your mouth is good for is being Vladimir Putin s cock holster. This is far from the first time Colbert has gone after Trump. Back in 2011, when the potential to run for president was only a rumor, and when Trump was best known for propagating the birther theory about President Obama, Colbert poked fun at Trump s pointless and non-sequitur way of speaking.In the video, Colbert began by talking about a GOP presidential debate that barely anyone chose to attend. About halfway through, though, Colbert started poking fun at Trump s style of saying nothing but using a lot of words to do it. In this, Trump compared gay marriage to using a long putter (post all jokes in the comments).TRUMP: It s like in golf. A lot of people I don t want this to sound trivial but a lot of people are switching to these really long putters, very unattractive. It s weird. You see these great players with these really long putters, because they can t sink three-footers anymore. And, I hate it. I am a traditionalist. I have so many fabulous friends who happen to be gay, but I am a traditionalist.Colbert figured that that form of  logic  could be applied to other things as well, like raising the debt ceiling or Medicare. He compared it to almond butter. Medicare would be like cuff links.Here s the video:Colbert wasn t too far off at all. Trump as Oval Office Occupier continues the same sort of speaking style, often making no sense at all. The perfect example was when he was far more interested in the chocolate cake he was eating when he bombed Syria than in the bombing itself. In fact, he forgot the name of the country he bombed.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",News,"May 6, 2017"

 Ellen DeGeneres Refuses To Have Donald Trump On Her Show; Here’s Why (VIDEO),"Ellen DeGeneres, perhaps more than anyone, has shown average Americans that LGBT people are just like other people, only in her case, a lot funnier, a better dancer and a lot nicer. She s so nice that she rarely weighs into political issues, so for liberals, it was refreshing when she told Matt Lauer of The Today Show that she would never have Trump on her show because  he s against everything that (she) stand(s) for. The daytime talkshow host has interviewed numerous politicians on her show, including Barack and Michelle Obama, Bernie Sanders and even George W. Bush. Obama even awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom. But for Trump, she says,  I m not going to change his mind,  and that kills it for her. We need to look at someone else who looks different than us and believes in something that we don t believe in and still accept them, and still let them have their rights. It s not really personal for DeGeneres, who said she s met Trump and never had a problem with him until he began running for president. I flew in his helicopter and did a bit with him. So I knew him then,  she told Lauer. I have not spoken to him since he s run for president or become president,  she said.Here s the video:DeGeneres came out 20 years ago. Since then, she has gained mainstream acceptance and there s little doubt that her show and her persona have helped change Americans  views on LGBT rights.She doesn t get political too often, but this isn t the first time she has spoken out against Trump. DeGeneres was the voice of Dory in the animated Pixar film Finding Dory. After Trump s inauguration, she noted that there were similarities between Dory and Trump s proposed border wall. Now, of course Finding Dory is about a fish named Dory,  DeGeneres said in front of a monitor displaying stills from the film.  And, Dory lives in Australia, and these are her parents, and they live in America. And I don t know what religion they are, but her dad sounds a little Jewish   doesn t matter. Dory arrives in America with her friends Marlin and Nemo,  the host continued.  She ends up at the Marine Life Institute behind a large wall. They all have to get over the wall and you won t believe it, but that wall has almost no effect in keeping them out.  Judging from the audience s applause, they particularly enjoyed DeGeneres  joke. Even though Dory gets into America, she ends up separated from her family, but the other animals help Dory,  DeGeneres began.  Animals that don t even need her. Animals that don t even have anything in common with her. They help her, even though they re completely different colors. Because that s what you do when you see someone in need   you help them. Source: USA TodayLet s hope DeGeneres speaks out more in the future. But when one of the nicest people in the world won t even welcome Trump, perhaps Trump should listen   not that he would.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images.",News,"May 6, 2017"
" Mike Huckabee Posts ‘Super Racist’ Cinco De Mayo Tweet, America Responds Perfectly","Ever since Donald Trump won the election, Republicans have felt they have free reign to show just how racist and despicable they can be. The party s true colors are on full display, and today s GOPers have no shame in expressing their most vile thoughts and offensive sense of humor.We saw this today when Mike Huckabee decided to celebrate Cinco de Mayo by tweeting an extremely racist message, which he obviously thought was hilarious. The problem is, no one else did.People have criticized Huckabee s jokes before, stating that they re either not funny or mean-spirited, and some are just plain confusing. In this case, Huckabee went full racist and unleashed his funny bone on Twitter.Huckabee stated that in celebration of Cinco de Mayo, he would  drink an entire jar of hot salsa , watch racist cartoons and  speak Spanish  all day. You can t get more racist than that: If you didn t think this  joke  was funny, you re not alone   tons of people on Twitter didn t enjoy it, either   and they didn t hesitate to tell him. Huckabee got dragged on Twitter, proving that America won t stand for the  values  that the Trump administration is trying to push on the country. Here are some of the best responses:      Here s our favorite, and it s probably the response that will hurt the most, because it s true!After his presidential campaign crashed and burned, coming to a pathetic end, Huckabee is struggling to stay relevant. He hopped on the Trump train for a while, and this joke explains exactly why he supported the undeserving POTUS   racists love to stick together.Hopefully, the backlash to this tweet will remind Huckabee that no one likes him and that racism is still not okay, even if we do have a racist president at the moment.Featured image via Getty Images",News,"May 5, 2017"
 Stephen Colbert Made A Joke About Trump And Now The Government Is Investigating Him,"On Monday night, Stephen Colbert was on fire.

You re the BLOATUS. You re the glutton with the button. You re a regular Gorge Washington. You re the presi-dunce, but you re turning into a real prick-tator. Sir, you attract more skinheads than free Rogaine. You have more people marching against you than cancer. You talk like a sign language gorilla who got hit in the head. In fact, the only thing your mouth is good for is being Vladimir Putin s [censored] holster. Your presidential library is going to be a kids  menu and a couple of Juggs magazines. The only thing smaller than your hands is your tax returns, and you can take that any way you want. Since then, conservatives have suddenly become the arbiter of political correctness and they suddenly give a crap about gay people, well, they care that their beloved leader had a sex joke made about him, which somehow makes Colbert homophobic. #FireColbert immediately became a trending hashtag on Twitter.I am a conservative who respects free speech.

Politically correct conservative little snowflakes are taking it to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to complain and they are opening an investigation. We are going to take the facts that we find and we are going to apply the law as it s been set out by the Supreme Court and other courts and we ll take the appropriate action,  he told Talk Radio 1210 WPHT Thursday. Traditionally, the agency has to decide, if it does find a violation, what the appropriate remedy should be,  he said.  A fine, of some sort, is typically what we do. Ajit Pai, who heads the administration, is an Obama appointee but was made head of the FCC by Donald Trump, so yes, he does have a political position and it s not hard to imagine that the thin-skinned dictator wannabe is putting pressure on Pai. After all, in Trump s short history, he has already fired several people who dared disagree with, or would potentially disagree with, Der Orange F hrer.That s not to imply that Pai is corrupt. He s already given himself an out for punishing Colbert and CBS by noting that standards are different for late night TV than they are for daytime or prime time.

Watch the interaction here:It s unbelievable, yet unfortunately believable, that a teacher in the year 2017 would not only think that it s okay to use the n-word, but to also try to argue with a black student about it, and insist that it s not racist.The Root reports: According to the TImes-Picayune, students went to the principal s office after class with the intent of staging a sit-in that instead turned into an hourlong assembly.Videos and photos of the assembly circulated on social media, too, with a different student talking about the stigma that black people face in society. It s good that a great discussion stemmed from such a profoundly awful situation, but hopefully, that teacher has also been reprimanded for his insanely derogatory speech. When our educators are trying to educate that racism is okay, that s not okay at all.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 5, 2017"
 Trump Accidentally Says He Wants Single Payer In Latest Tweet – Twitter Lets Him Know (TWEETS),"It can easily be said that Donald Trump is a few sandwiches short of a picnic, and he just proved that fact once again with his latest tweet.Trump, since the start of his campaign, has been telling everyone that he s going to get rid of Obamacare and replace it with something better, and quite honestly if his latest tweet is what he wants   liberals will likely get on board. However, in his idiocy, he probably doesn t realize what he just said.Trump tweeted out: Of course the Australians have better healthcare than we do  everybody does. ObamaCare is dead! But our healthcare will soon be great. Of course the Australians have better healthcare than we do  everybody does. ObamaCare is dead! But our healthcare will soon be great.  Donald J.

Please do!!Australia has a Medicare for all program for their citizens, and nations around the world have similar health systems that provide care for their nation s citizens. They take out the middleman of for-profit insurance, and give direct, affordable care, only increasing taxes slightly, and you no longer have the added expense of insurance premiums. AND EVERYONE IS COVERED.Now, this isn t likely what Trump meant to say, but it is what he said.The American Health Care Act, better known as Trumpcare, that passed yesterday in the House is simply a gift to the wealthy while stripping insurance and necessary benefits from those who need it most. That s NOT what Australia has, and would be far worse than anything else in the world.Twitter quickly reminded Trump that he s a moron:@realDonaldTrump Australia is part of the rest of the civilized world that has Universal HC.We can do better.#AHCA#FridayFeeling #TheResistance pic.twitter.com/X1K7f6mAg3  Holly O'Reilly (@AynRandPaulRyan) May 5, 2017@realDonaldTrump And why do you think that everybody else has better healthcare than we do?

 Trump Nominee Brags That Taking Away Healthcare Will Force More Americans To Convert To Christianity,"Now we know the real reason why Republicans oppose universal healthcare.Donald Trump s Army Secretary nominee Mark Green is a Tennessee state senator who thinks healthcare is an obstacle that prevents churches from converting people to Christianity.Apparently, is people are healthy, it s a lot harder for them to be taken advantage of. The sick, on the other hand, will be desperate to feel better, and without healthcare to make them better, Green says they ll be forced to turn to God. The person who s in need   they look to the government for the answer, not God, and I think in that way government has done an injustice that s even bigger than just the creation of an entitlement welfare state,  Green said in 2015. In this setting, I ll share the story, I think it interrupts the opportunity for people to come to a saving knowledge of who God is. I see our sort of government-based assistance taking God out of the picture,  Green said.  If you look at the Gospels and you go and study the Gospels, every person who came to Christ came to Christ with a physical need. It was either hunger or a disease. People go to God because of a physical need and they walk away with a spiritual need met. In other words, Green opposes healthcare because he wants sick people to be desperate enough to convert to his religion. This is all about forcing people to accept a religious belief if they are sick instead of giving them the medical care they need. Basically, this is blackmail on a sickening level.Republicans are basically saying that sick people should have to become devout Christians first before getting the healthcare they need.On Thursday, House Republicans voted to strip healthcare from millions of Americans. The bill also fails to cover those with pre-existing conditions and gives a massive tax gift to the wealthy. One wonders if Green s beliefs figured into their morally bankrupt decision.The bottom line is that people should not have to adopt a religious belief in order to get healthcare.Such a system is cruel and further breaks down faith in religious institutions. Churches would become nothing more than prisons where the less devout and non-believers are punished by being denied real healthcare.That s not what America is all about.Featured Image: Wikimedia",News,"May 5, 2017"
 Trump Says He’s Going To Save the Country Money By Going Golfing Again,"The current occupant of the White House is occupying a golf course again, marking this (a three day weekend for him) his 21st visit to a golf course as  president.  Just after gutting health care for up to 24 million Americans, then throwing a kegger for Republicans who were complicit in an attack on their own constituents, Donald Trump decided to take a vacay and go golfing.This morning Trump tweeted from his social media podium,  Rather than causing a big disruption in N.Y.C., I will be working out of my home in Bedminster, N.J. this weekend. Also saves country money! Rather than causing a big disruption in N.Y.C., I will be working out of my home in Bedminster, N.J. this weekend. Also saves country money!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 5, 2017So, after sticking a knife in the middle class and lower-income Americans by passing Trumpcare through the House, the former reality show star traipsed off to his fancy golf club which costs members $300,000 a shot. Again, that was after he gave the top 2 percent a trillion dollar tax cut while gifting the bottom 40 percent with having to pay for it with their health care. Are we tired of all this winning yet? Apparently, the 70-year-old alleged president is so he s taking a break.Trump is spending a long weekend at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, NJ.This is his 21st visit to a golf course as president. https://t.co/6Cijy24jLr  Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) May 5, 2017While the amateur president claims he ll be  working  at his  home  which is not really his home since he s supposed to reside in the White House, his work day doesn t look very filled up, according to Politico.TRUMP S SCHEDULE: President Donald Trump is at his Bedminster Golf Club in New Jersey and has no public events scheduled.That s all that is listed on his schedule. The former reality show star thinks being leader of the free world is a 9-5 type of gig with an extra day off for knifing the poor and middle class.During the same period of time in Barack Obama s presidency, he golfed once. One time. And Donald Trump repeatedly disparaged him for it. As of April 2nd, Trump spent nine consecutive weekends at Trump-owned properties, bringing up once more his mounting conflicts of interest.Trump was already in New York City where he could have spent time with his wife, who is totally in love with him, and their son, Barron. But, according to Trump, he didn t want to  cause a disruption.  Now far be it from us to call him a Big Old Liar, but Trump didn t remain in NYC, because everyone there hates him. And that may or may not include his wife. Who knows.It s really bad optics to screw the poor over then go golfing with wealthy people. To Trump, saving us money means costing us more money.

 FDA Department Gets Order From White House Saying All Office TVs Must Be Programmed To Fox News Only,"A little over 100 days into America s experiment in dystopian rule took a predictably sad turn: The Trump administration, apparently tired of allowing people to watch non-propaganda, have begun ordering government agencies to only allow Fox News to be played in government buildings. Fox News, of course, has operated as little more than a full-time state news agency for the Trump administration.The Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), operating within the FDA, was given this message after employees asked why all of their monitors had inexplicably been changed to Fox News:I wanted to let everyone know that the reason for the change from CNN to FOX.The reason for the change is that a decision from the current administration adminstrative officials has requested that all monitors, under our control, on the White Oak Campus, display FOX news.Sorry for the inconvenience, but I am unable to change any of the monitors to any other news source at this time.Reporter Julia Reinstein confirmed the email from a source within the research center.Someone at CBER sent me the email which told staff TVs had been switched to Fox News by order of the admin pic.twitter.com/rsCzpOtdpv  Julia Reinstein (@juliareinstein) May 5, 2017Reinstein got a picture confirming that the TVs within an office filled with serious scientists and researchers trying to do their jobs really were streaming Fox News.Here's Fox News on the TVs at CBER, same day an email went out to staff saying it had been switched from CNN to Fox by order of Trump admin pic.twitter.com/uVPx8jekIk  Julia Reinstein (@juliareinstein) May 5, 2017Fox News has weathered its own scandals recently by doubling, then tripling down on unwavering support of Donald Trump. Its years of anti-Obama hysterics have given way to a Trump promotional operation that is breathtaking to watch. The mental gymnastics the network pulls in order to defend Trump s (largely unsuccessful) first 100 days has become the stuff of legend, including what may be one of the most unintentionally hilarious tweets ever published.Jobless rate after first 3 months: Trump vs. Obama vs. Bush vs. Clinton. pic.twitter.com/EUTEseJyTj  Fox News (@FoxNews) April 29, 2017Unsurprisingly, all of this favorable coverage has pleased Trump, who is reportedly obsessed with what people are saying about him on cable news.

 Dumbass Alaska Lawmaker Claims Women Have Abortions For A ‘Free Trip To The City’ (VIDEO),"Generations upon generations of incest have apparently caused the gerbils operating the brain of Alaska state Representative David Eastman to go on strike. As House Republicans are directly attacking the American people with their new  Trumpcare  plan, news broke that Eastman   a lawmaker from Wasilla, Sarah Palin s neck of th1e woods   decided to make the GOP sound even more heartless and stupid than they previously seemed.Eastman, who views the elimination of a clump of cells as  the ultimate form of child abuse,  recently tacked an anti-abortion message onto a state House resolution meant to raise awareness about sexual assault and child abuse   a message he says could not possibly be delivered without badgering people about abortion. Abortion is a very serious issue, and it needs to be talked about,  Eastman says, adding that women get pregnant just so they can get a  free trip to the city  for their glamorous abortion: We have folks who try to get pregnant in this state so that they can get a free trip to the city, and we have folks who want to carry their baby past the point of being able to have an abortion in this state so that they can have a free trip to Seattle. Medicaid can fund a woman s travel to Anchorage or Seattle if they seek an abortion. Asked for evidence that women get pregnant just to take advantage of the free travel   a nonsensical claim   Eastman said that a number of people have come to (his) office with stories, experiences.  He offered no evidence to back the claim.This isn t the first horrible thing Eastman has done or said. KTUU notes that he recently was the only person to vote against resolutions honoring black soldiers who helped build the Alaska Highway during World War II and another honoring Hmong and Lao veterans who fought for the U.S. during the Vietnam War. Those resolutions had otherwise unanimous support.It is unclear if he has f*cked himself yet, or if he still needs to do that.Watch him shame his state below:Featured image via video screenshot",News,"May 5, 2017"
 Rape Can Be Considered A Pre-Existing Condition Under GOP Healthcare Law,"House Republicans managed to pass their healthcare bill on Thursday, just barely, and it is truly a despicable piece of legislation. The right-wing nutjobs who have taken over the Republican party, AKA the Freedom Caucus, refused to vote in favor of the bill as long as Obamacare s protections for pre-existing conditions remained intact. So, the GOP said the hell with it and gutted protections for the sick in order to gain their votes.Think it can t get any worse? WRONG. As if taking health care from 24 million people and removing protections for pre-existing conditions isn t bad enough, what qualifies as a pre-existing condition is even worse.Among possible pre-existing conditions that could result in outrageous premiums are rape and sexual assault. Seriously. Rape.NYMag reports:The new MacArthur-Meadows Amendment will allow states to discriminate based on medical history, reportedly without addressing the subsequent high cost of health care for millions of Americans.In addition to rape, postpartum depression, cesarean sections, and surviving domestic violence are all considered preexisting conditions. Companies can also deny coverage for gynecological services and mammograms.The amendment also says that Nothing in this Act shall be construed as permitting health insurance issuers to discriminate in rates for health insurance coverage by gender.  But, ummm, did you look at what qualifies as a pre-existing condition? Insurance companies don t have to cover  gynecological services and mammograms  that screen for cancer? How many men are gonna need a c-section? How many men have postpartum depression? How many men need a pap smear to check for cervical cancer? Seems pretty damn obvious that being a woman is a pre-existing condition itself.Paul Ryan and Donald Trump have tried to claim that pre-existing conditions are covered, but that isn t exactly the truth. The MacArthur-Meadows amendment  would allow states to opt out of federal regulations and allow insurance companies to charge higher premiums for people who have pre-existing conditions. Since this was the law of the land before the Affordable Care Act, we know what happens when you give insurance companies this option: they set premiums so high that sick people are priced out of insurance coverage altogether.So now, besides the shame, fear, and trauma that have traditionally kept women from seeking medical care after they are sexually assaulted, rape victims now get to worry that they will lose their health insurance if they get help. What the actual f*ck is wrong with these people? This is as disgusting as it gets.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"May 4, 2017"
 Bernie Bursts Out Laughing After Trump Unknowingly Praises Australia’s Universal Health Care (VIDEO),"Hours after helping begin to repeal America s universal health care system, Trump was in New York smiling and posing for the cameras as he sat next to the Australian Prime Minister. Then he opened his mouth.In a surreal reminder of just how oblivious Trump is, the president who had spent months pushing for Congress to strip access to medical care away from Americans turned to the Australian PM and remarked that Australia has a much better health care system than the United States. We have a failing health care. I shouldn t say this to the great gentleman and my friend from Australia because you have better health care than we do. Like many developed nations, Australia has universal health care for all citizens. They have  better health care than we do  in large part because Republicans spend so much time and energy ensuring many Americans can t get access to insurance.

Thank you, Mr. President. Let us move to a Medicare for all system that does what every other major country on Earth does: Guarantee healthcare to all people for a fraction of the cost that we spend. Thank you, Mr. President. We ll quote you on the floor of the Senate.

 American Medical Association Eviscerates GOP For Snatching Healthcare Away From Millions,"House Republicans voted on Thursday to rip healthcare away from millions of Americans. Among those who are slamming the GOP for this despicable act are doctors, who know just how bad this will be for their patients.Following the passage of the American Health Care Act, the American Medical Association issued a scathing statement. The AMA, which is the largest group of its kind in the U.S. and represents more than 20,000 physicians, slammed the bill for leaving millions without access to medical care. The bill passed by the House today will result in millions of Americans losing access to quality, affordable health insurance and those with pre-existing health conditions face the possibility of going back to the time when insurers could charge them premiums that made access to coverage out of the question,  AMA President Andrew Gurman said.The group conceded that action is needed to improve the current health care insurance system.  After all, no one has ever claimed that Obamacare was perfect. However, the GOP s bill is not the answer we need. The AMA urged the White House and  the Senate to work toward  bipartisan solutions. The AMA urges the Senate and the Administration to work with physician, patient, hospital and other provider groups to craft bipartisan solutions so all American families can access affordable and meaningful coverage, while preserving the safety net for vulnerable populations,  he said.The CBO has estimated that 24 million people will lose their healthcare coverage under the Republican plan. The elderly and sick (you know, the people who need medical care the most) will be hit the hardest by the GOP bill. Under the AHCA, states will be able to gut protections for pre-existing conditions and tell insurance companies that they can charge sick people as much as they want, even if that means these people are priced out of coverage altogether.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"May 4, 2017"
 Ex-GOP Congressman Might As Well Be Wearing A Hood During Latest Interview (VIDEO),"The depths of Republican cruelty is on full display this week after the House passed the disastrous unread/unscored bill that we will forever call Trumpcare. It seems though, that even some Republicans are admitting that single payer or at least some form of actual universal healthcare is ideal, but, at least according to ex-congressman and deadbeat dad Joe Walsh, we can t have nice things because we have black people.Walsh, who for some unfathomable reason, is an MSNBC contributor, sparred with host Ali Velshi, who told the ex-congressman that our healthcare system ranks last among the 11 wealthiest nations. All the others have universal healthcare. That s when things turned ugly. You can t compare the rest of the world to us,  Walsh replied.  They do not have the big diverse populations that we have. They do not have the inner-city populations that we have. Later, when Velshi brought up the point again   that the United States ranks poorly in life expectancy, access to care and a variety of other measures   Walsh again brought up diversity. I love you, my friend, but you cannot   Sweden does not have our inner-city population,  he said.  Norway, these countries do not have   you re talking about countries the size of India with homogenous populations, Ali. You can t compare them to what we have! Source: Talking Points MemoVelshi, to his credit, didn t back down. He mentioned Canada, which is actually more ethnically diverse than the United States and has better health care.Here s the video:Walsh, of course, has the entire issue completely backwards. Yes, people of color, and in particular African-Americans and Hispanics, do have a lower life expectancy, although that is improving. But that s not because they are black, as Walsh implies. It s because they are more likely to live in poverty and they are less likely to have insurance.While a plurality (45%) of the uninsured are non-Hispanic Whites, people of color are at higher risk of being uninsured than Whites. People of color make up 41% of the nonelderly U.S. population but account for over half of the total nonelderly uninsured population (Figure 4). The disparity in insurance coverage is especially high for Hispanics, who account for 20% of the nonelderly population but nearly a third (32%) of the nonelderly uninsured population. Hispanics and Blacks have significantly higher uninsured rates (17.2% and 12.2%, respectively) than Whites (8.1%).Source: KFF.orgInstead of addressing poverty and lack of healthcare availability, Republicans like Walsh would rather use this totally fixable disparity to deepen the racial divide in this country and to foster hate. As for Walsh, he might as well wear that hood you know he owns in public. He s not even pretending anymore.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"May 4, 2017"
 Trump Once Again Offends Australian Leader For The Dumbest Imaginable Reason (VIDEO),"If someone had said just four months ago that our relationship with Australia would suddenly become precarious, the world would have laughed in their face. Then, somehow, we got Donald Trump and our relationship with The Land Down Under suddenly became contentious. On Thursday, for the second time in his short presidency, Donald Trump screwed over the Australian Prime Minister   all so he could celebrate the House s healthcare vote.The weird feud (for lack of a better word) began very soon after Trump took office. Trump hung up on Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull over a dispute about refugees after bragging about his win. Trump called the call, which was reportedly his fourth with a world leader that day,  the worst call by far. It got worse on Thursday when Trump and the Prime Minister were supposed to hash out, or at least cool their differences. You can bet that Turnbull is feeling anything but warm toward the United States after Trump once again snubbed him, just so he could celebrate half a legislative victory.The White House had initially set aside a chunk of time early Thursday evening for the two leaders to hold a bilateral meeting ahead of their joint commemoration of the 75th Anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea at a dinner later that night.Instead, Trump is now scheduled to spend 30 minutes with Turnbull ahead of the ceremony, according to an updated schedule released by the White House.Source: Washington PostThis insult was on top of the fact that Trump was already treating Turnbull like a second class leader. Trump hosts most foreign leaders in Washington or at Mar-a-Lago, where they are treated like royalty. The meeting with Turnbull, even in its planned form, was going to be held at the Peninsula Hotel in Manhattan, with little fanfare.Australia, of course, is treating the incident with far more class than they ve been shown by Trump. The delegation does not feel snubbed at all,  said a senior Australian official.  It certainly understands the significant legislative achievement. The program was always on the understanding of fluidity. It s doubtful they re that understanding. They, after all, come from a country that cares about its people s health. Plus, this was only half a victory. The disastrous TrumpCare still needs to pass the Senate.Featured image via Cameron Spencer/Getty Images and Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"May 4, 2017"

 Leading Senator In Trump-Russia Investigation Reveals STARTLING Odds For Trump’s Impeachment,"Ever since Donald Trump won the election (unfairly, with the help of Russia), Americans have been calling for his removal from office. These pleas have only gotten louder as Trump s presidency went on, as the incompetent POTUS repeatedly proves that he cannot do his job properly and is a danger to the country (and world).Now that Trump has passed his first 100 days, the calls for his impeachment couldn t be clearer. He s proven that he can t get anything done and wants to play golf instead. He s involved in numerous probes regarding his Russia scandal and business conflicts. Amid the controversies and a historically low approval rating, even GOP lawmakers are abandoning Trump at record speed   and many are calling for impeachment or for invoking the 25th Amendment, which allows presidents who are mentally unfit to be replaced. Some lawmakers have even said Trump isn t going to finish his first term.Stephen Moore, a senior economist at the Heritage Foundation and Trump campaign adviser, commented on Trump s plummeting approval rating in an interview with the New Yorker: You can t govern this country with a forty-per-cent approval rate   you just can t. Nobody in either party is going to bend over backwards for Trump if over half the country doesn t approve of him. That, to me, should be a big warning sign. Jerry Taylor, president of the libertarian Niskanen Center, also weighed in on why Trump s presidency is failing so quickly: The reality is, he is governing as if he is the president of a Third World country. Power is held by family and incompetent loyalists whose main calling card is the fact that Donald Trump can trust them, not whether they have any expertise. My guess is that there s only between 50 and 100 Republican members of the House that are truly enthusiastic about Donald Trump as president. The balance sees him as somewhere between a deep and dangerous embarrassment and a threat to the Constitution. Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, has even predicted Trump s odds for impeachment as a striking 2-1.Professor of constitutional law at Harvard Law School Laurence Tribe said that it s entirely possible that we will invoke the 25th Amendment  well before 2020 , and that it s not a  liberal fantasy  but instead can be  an entirely plausible tool    especially in Trump s case. At this point, getting Trump impeached would be a blessing.Featured image via Scott Olson / Getty Images",News,"May 4, 2017"
 ‘Cases Upon Cases Of Beer’: GOP Organizes Booze Party To Celebrate Stripping 24 Million Of Insurance,"Republicans haven t read their own bill, aren t waiting around to see it independently scored, and seem to have only a limited interest in what the devastating effects may be, but they do know one thing: After they vote to strip an estimated 24 million people of health insurance and bankrupt countless more they plan to get hammered.Paul Ryan once inexplicably boasted that he d been fantasizing about killing Medicaid since he was  drinking at a keg  in college. Now on the verge of destroying America s healthcare system more completely than Fratboy Ryan ever dared dream, he seems to be channeling that same impulse. Although going on a booze bender hours after signing the literal death warrants for many Americans tends to look pretty bad, which is why Republicans tried to hide the beers under a sheet. It didn t work.Cases upon cases of beer just rolled into the Capitol on a cart covered in a sheet. Spotted Bud Light peeking out from the sheet  Alexandra Jaffe (@ajjaffe) May 4, 2017Even Roman Emperor Nero had enough sense not to be seen pounding Bud Light while the city burned.Speaking of historically bad world leaders, the White House is said to be hosting a party for Republicans to celebrate tonight:Beer being rolled into the Capitol   & @LACaldwellDC reports that Republicans will also head to White House for a congratulatory celebration https://t.co/cAC3r5eVdJ  Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) May 4, 2017Other Republicans were in an equally celebratory mood   and equally tasteless. While congressional aides trickled into the Capitol building, someone started blasting the theme from  Rocky.  (The fact that Rocky actually doesn t win the fight at the end of the movie was lost on the Republicans in the room. Handshakes, smiles, and high fives were going around.)The celebratory way in which Republicans are treating this bill is in stark contrast to reality. The AHCA will almost surely mean millions lose health insurance. Those Americans with so-called  pre-existing conditions  can expect to either completely lose their coverage or find it so expensive that they may have no choice but to go without. A brand new study found that the ACA cut personal bankruptcies in the United States by half   that progress will be erased.Politically, the bill, likely represents suicide for many Republicans. As statistician Nate Silver pointed out, Obamacare was divisive and unpopular when it first passed, but this bill is really, really unpopular   orders of magnitude more so than the ACA. And unlike the ACA, the Republican plan doesn t have the benefit of actually working once it s passed. People won t even be able to  grow to like it  because   as the CBO score on the initial bill found   the legislation is a dumpster fire.All of this to say: Drink up, Republicans! Something tells me your hangover is going to last a while.Featured image via Eric Thayer/Getty Images",News,"May 4, 2017"
